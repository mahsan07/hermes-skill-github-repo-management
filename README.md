# GitHub Repository Management

> Clone, create, fork, and manage GitHub repositories, remotes, and releases.

This repository packages one focused Hermes skill as a public, documentation-first capability. The blueprint below explains the actual operating surfaces, control points, failure paths, and evidence expected from a trustworthy run.

## The problem it solves

Tool integrations can create accidental side effects when authentication, scope, preview, execution, and verification are not separated.

## System components

- **Repository intent**
- **Local Git state**
- **GitHub repository API**
- **Remote and release objects**
- **Verified repository state**

## Execution walkthrough

1. **Confirm owner repository and requested operation**
2. **Inspect local branches remotes and status**
3. **Preview create fork or release changes**
4. **Execute the authorized GitHub operation**
5. **Fetch repository and remote state again**
6. **Report URLs SHAs and visibility**

## Example request

> In a disposable test workspace, clone, create, fork, and manage GitHub repositories, remotes, and releases. Return the result, the evidence used to verify it, and any limitations or actions that still require approval.

## Evidence contract

- `request.json` — captures request.
- `inspection.json` — captures inspection.
- `preview.json` — captures preview.
- `execution.json` — captures execution.
- `verification.json` — captures verification.
- `receipt.json` — captures receipt.

A run is complete only when the final artifact can be reopened or re-read and compared with the requested acceptance criteria. An attempted command or successful API response alone is not sufficient proof.

## Safety boundaries

- Confirm the exact target, owner, environment, and authority before acting.
- Preview consequential changes and pause at the approval gate.
- Keep credentials, personal data, and private endpoints out of logs and examples.
- Preserve user work and avoid unrelated changes.
- Report verification failures as incomplete work.

Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), and the detailed [How it works](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) guide before connecting this workflow to a real service or production environment.

## Maturity

This is a public reference workflow extracted from a larger private workbench. It does not include a hosted runtime, credentials, or private infrastructure. Adopters must connect compatible tools and validate behavior in their own environment.

## Contributing

Contributions should improve capability accuracy, safe defaults, reproducible examples, or verification evidence without broadening the skill beyond its stated purpose. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
